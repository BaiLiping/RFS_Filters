here are a lot of errors in this codebase, as none of the people involved in this project were professionals in this field. I’ve left it as is for those who eventually find their way here.

All the code has been converted from MATLAB, and plenty of open‑source implementations are available. If you want the original MATLAB version, just search for Ángel García‑Fernández: https://github.com/Agarciafernandez/MTT

Random Finite Set (RFS) theory is an elegant mathematical framework that incorporates set‑cardinality dynamics into the propagation process—that’s it. It can be applied to many existing methods, giving rise to an endless number of publication possibilities. As an outsider, I find that amusing. Personally, I don’t necessarily trust everything in this field. It’s very easy to fake things, making simple ideas seem more sophisticated than they are—a perfect environment for mediocrity to hide.

The Poisson multi‑Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter is a kitchen‑sink approach—essentially a multiple‑hypothesis filter—and RFS is a wrapper.
