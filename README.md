This codebase contains many errors; none of the contributors were professionals in this field. I have left the code as is for those who eventually find their way here.

The code was converted from MATLAB, and there are numerous open‑source implementations available. For the original MATLAB version by Ángel García‑Fernández, see: https://github.com/Agarciafernandez/MTT

Random Finite Set (RFS) theory provides an elegant framework that incorporates set‑cardinality dynamics into the propagation process. It can be applied to many existing methods, which has led to a large number of publications. 

The Poisson multi‑Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter can be viewed as a broad, multiple‑hypothesis approach, with RFS serving as the wrapper framework.
